# RPi-GPIO-Cycling-Output
# Test program to cycle four Raspberry Pi GPIOs ON and OFF
#
#  
#
#  First try at making GPIOs cylce ON and OFF - for the Node.JS interface I'm building
#
#  I built this to cycle through 4 Raspbery Pi GPIO outputs so that they 
#  could be looped back to the Digital Input GPIO pins of a Seed reTerminal DM
#  and be used to generate a test signal for the node.js program I've been
#  working on.
#
#  GPIO Output pins: BCM: 5 on hardware pin # 29
#                    BCM: 6 on hardware pin # 31
#                    BCM: 12 on hardware pin # 32
#                    BCM: 13 on hardware pin # 33
